# Sociology-Survey-Completion-
Task:Created an exploratory data analysis application using R and R Studio containing 4,037 observations of respondents from a survey to analyze the age and time completion of the survey.
Created a subset dataset of each age group to facilitate more detailed analysis of the relationship between age and time spent completing the survey.

 
                                 18-29 Years Old      60+ Years Old
Survey CompleFon Time
Mean                                1343.059            2293.814
Standard DeviaAon                   4772.985            6304.569

Based on the descripative statistics that you obtained:
One conclusion I can draw about the Ame that it took respondents to complete the survey is that the age range of 18–29-year-olds completes the survey quicker than the age range of 60 plus year Olds. This is shown in stats since the mean (average) of survey compleAon for 18–29-year-olds is 1343.059. Whereas the mean of survey compleAon for 60 plus year old is 2293. 814. AddiAonally, the standard deviaAon of the age range of 18–29-year-olds is 4772.985. Whereas the standard deviaAon of the age range of 60 plus year olds is 6304.569, meaning the survey compleAon Ames for 60 plus year olds are more spread out than the survey compleAon Ames for 18–29-year-olds.
