# Sociology-Survey-Completion-
Task:Created an exploratory data analysis application using R and R Studio containing 4,037 observations of respondents from a survey to analyze the age and time completion of the survey.
Created a subset dataset of each age group to facilitate more detailed analysis of the relationship between age and time spent completing the survey.

 
                                 18-29 Years Old      60+ Years Old
Survey Completetion Time
Mean                                1343.059            2293.814
Standard Deviation                   4772.985            6304.569

Based on the descriptive statistics obtained, one conclusion that can be drawn about the time it took respondents to complete the survey is that individuals in the age range of 18–29 years complete the survey more quickly than those in the age range of 60 years and older. This is evident in the statistics, as the mean (average) survey completion time for 18–29-year-olds is 1343.059, whereas the mean for 60 plus-year-olds is 2293.814. Additionally, the standard deviation for the age range of 18–29 years is 4772.985, while the standard deviation for the age range of 60 plus years is 6304.569. This indicates that the survey completion times for 60 plus-year-olds are more dispersed or spread out compared to the survey completion times for 18–29-year-olds.
